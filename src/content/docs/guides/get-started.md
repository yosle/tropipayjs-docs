So, do you want to start receiving internacional payments with Tropipay...You came to the right place.

TropiPay is an electronic wallet that allows you to execute the most common financial operations of the day to day. This is SDK for Typescript and Javacript that helps you build integrations with the Tropipay platform in an easier way. Can save you a lot of time and effort implementing all the API features. You can use this library with CommonJS system (node + express) or ES6 module system (NextJS).

## Getting the help you can

It's allways a good idea to make extensive test on your integration. So
we recommend to use the sandbox for testing your integration. This test environment doesn't use real money and you can safely test the API endpoint whihout any risk. [The test environment is accesible here](/https://www.tropipay-dev.herokuapp.com/).

Test environment is completely independent of the real Tropipay API. Credentials created in the test environment can't be used in Tropipay API and viceversa. Often, this test account requires some extra configuration to work properly. There's probably the best way of getting updates of any changes that could affect your development. It's always a good idea contact de Tropipay Developers Support before making any test. They can provide you a already setup test account if needed.
